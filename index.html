      <p>Before writing a single line of code, be sure that you have a new repository (with a README!) called cookie-stand, and do your work in that directory. Each day you'll be working in separate branches. Once the repo is initialized and set up today, switch to a new branch for your work. Branch names can be whatever you want; it is suggested that you use some sort of standard organization such as day-feature for the branch name, such as tue-models.</p>
